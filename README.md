## Project Description
This project aims to create a process that will generate test data sets based on admin-selected criteria. 

Test data are defined as valid records for a set of standard and custom Salesforce objects that represent complete stories and singficant use cases/permutations that are represent programs or personas in the org.

Major use cases for these data sets include:
* QA an org populated with permutations of all, or nearly all, the types of data that are relavent to the project.
* Be able to reliably and easily load sample data into a given Salesforce org (production, sandbox or scratch).
* Have a data set for demos, potentially with the ability to add specific sets of data that could be used for story based training materials.
* Have a data set that ensures the privacy of people represented in the dataset (ie not real names)
* Have data sets at scales that allow for testing bulk data processing.

## Project Vision/Goals
* Everyone has access to an open process/tool to reliably generate sample data for telling user stories
* Admin-friendly interface to define requirements for the data generated 
* Data sets generated through this process could be appopriate for medium-sized orgs and can fit in a sandbox
* Data sets generated through this process could be valid for large data valume (LDV) testing
* Develop process for how you can build test data sets that follow a story (automated? manual? best practice doc?)
* Prioritize leadership development/capacity building through project leadership/contributions from customers, partners, devs, etc
