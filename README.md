## Project Theme

How would you categorize your project? For example, are you creating an app and/or component, writing documentation, focusing on the community ecosystem, making videos, etc. [Learn how](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Welcome/wiki/SFDO-Community-Sprints-Topic-Overview) this information loops back into Sprint project work!

Proposed theme:
* theme-community-ecosystem

## Project Vertical
Everyone.

This project is aimed at helping ease the process of generating test data for projects. Nearly all Salesforce projects benefit from improving this process.

### Project Description
This project aims to create a process that will generate test data sets based on admin-selected criteria.

Test data are defined as valid records for a set of standard and custom Salesforce objects that represent complete stories and singficant use cases/permutations that are represent programs or personas in the org.

Major use cases for these data sets include:
* QA an org populated with permutations of all, or nearly all, the types of data that are relavent to the project.
* Be able to reliably and easily load sample data into a given Salesforce org (production, sandbox or scratch).
* Have a data set for demos, potentially with the ability to add specific sets of data that could be used for story based training materials.
* Have a data set that ensures the privacy of people represented in the dataset (ie not real names)
* Have data sets at scales that allow for testing bulk data processing.

### Project Vision/Goals
* Everyone has access to an open process/tool to reliably generate sample data for telling user stories
* Admin-friendly interface to define requirements for the data generated
* Data sets generated through this process could be appopriate for medium-sized orgs and can fit in a sandbox
* Data sets generated through this process could be valid for large data valume (LDV) testing
* Develop process for how you can build test data sets that follow a story (automated? manual? best practice doc?)
* Prioritize leadership development/capacity building through project leadership/contributions from customers, partners, devs, etc

### Project Team Accomplishments
* [3/1 -> 4/1 virtual sprint]
    * Determined that Snowfakery accomplishes many of the original requirements brainstormed at the Philly Sprint (fall 2019) (namely: ability to generate mock data with related tables, random names and values, standard and custom objects, datasets of any size/scale, ability to populate Salesforce orgs)
    * Socialized Snowfakery to community members
    * Onboarded project leadership from multiple orgs and began application for inclusion in Open Source Commons program
    * Refined use cases and differentiated Snowfakery from (1) existing tools in the market (2) proprietary tools at Salesforce (3) Full Sandbox product
    * Brainstormed 2+ potential directions for extending Snowfakery to include an admin-friendly web interface
    * Reviewed documentation and install steps
    * Overhauled ReadMe file
